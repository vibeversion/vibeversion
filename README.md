# VibeVersion: Version your vision.

The Vibe Coding Revolution Needs a New Kind of Version Control

Vibe Coding is transforming how we build. It's an innovative development style where you collaborate directly with AI, guiding it through natural language prompts to generate and refine code. This marks a significant shift from explicit programming to **intent-driven development**, where AI autonomously modifies multiple components simultaneously based on your abstract input.

This revolutionary approach presents unique challenges for traditional version control systems like Git:

* **Philosophical Mismatch**: Git assumes human-driven, granular changes, focusing on "meaningful commit units." Vibe Coding, however, involves AI making broad, often ambiguous, or exploratory changes across components from a single instruction. This fundamental difference leads to a diluted sense of "what" and "why" in Git's history.
* **Chaotic & Noisy History**: AI's frequent, small modifications, instant rollbacks, and experimental changes clash with Git's goal of an organized, linear history. The result is a commit log filled with "AI auto-updates" and fragmented changes, making it incredibly difficult to trace original intent or debug.
* **Invisible Progress**: How do you truly visualize your project's evolution when the core isn't just lines of code, but the continuous dialogue with your AI partner? Git struggles to convey the story of iterative prompting and AI responses.
* **Bridging Human & AI**: Integrating your own manual refinements into an AI-driven workflow becomes cumbersome, lacking clear distinction and traceability between human interventions and AI's outputs.

**VibeVersion** is built from the ground up to solve these problems, designed specifically for the fluid, **intent-driven** and **exploratory** world of Vibe Coding.

## How VibeVersion Transforms Your Workflow

VibeVersion shifts the focus from managing mere code changes to **versioning your entire creative process** with AI.

* **Prompt-Centric History**: Every instruction you give your AI, every prompt, becomes a first-class citizen in your project's history. Link your prompts directly to the code they generate, ensuring you always know the "why" behind the "what." This makes your history meaningful, not just a series of code diffs.
* **Session-Based Workflow**: Organize your development journey into "sessions" â€“ distinct periods of focused work with a clear intent. This supports Vibe Coding's **iterative and exploratory nature**, allowing you to easily revisit, branch from, or discard experimental paths without polluting your main history.
* **Unified Project Traceability**: Beyond just code, VibeVersion tracks and links all your project assets: prompts, AI-generated code, configurations, design documents generated by AI, and even your test cases. See the complete lineage of any feature and understand its **semantic evolution**.
* **Seamless Human-AI Collaboration**: Integrate your manual code refinements effortlessly. VibeVersion clearly distinguishes human-made changes from AI-generated ones, preserving the clarity of your project's evolution and allowing for easy **post-hoc commentary and organization**.
* **Intuitive Visual Timeline**: Forget cryptic commit messages. Experience your project's history as a living timeline, showcasing key decisions, AI interactions, and the precise moment your vision came to life, making the abstract concepts of intent and session tangible.

## VibeVersion vs. Git: A Philosophical Divide

Traditional Git excels at tracking human-driven, granular code changes. However, its core assumptions can become friction points in an AI-accelerated Vibe Coding workflow. VibeVersion addresses these directly:

| Feature/Philosophy      | Git (Traditional VCS)                                      | VibeVersion (For Vibe Coding)                                 | Why it Matters for Vibe Coding                                   |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Unit of Change** | **Commit**: A snapshot of code changes, often manual.      | **Prompt/Session**: An expression of intent, an AI interaction, or a focused human work unit. | Captures the *why* and the *process*, not just the *what*.      |
| **History Focus** | **Code Diffs**: Tracks line-by-line changes over time.     | **Intent & Evolution**: Traces the unfolding vision, AI responses, and human refinements. | Provides semantic meaning and context to rapid AI-driven changes, avoiding noisy histories. |
| **Change Granularity** | Often small, human-crafted increments.                      | Can be vast, broad, AI-generated sweeps or focused human tweaks. | Accommodates AI's broad refactors and micro-changes transparently without manual overhead. |
| **Collaboration Model** | Human-to-human code sharing and merging.                    | Human-AI partnership, with AI as a first-class collaborator.   | Built for the conversational, iterative nature of AI development. |
| **Traceability** | Code changes traced to commit messages and authors.         | Code traced to its originating prompt, session, and developer's original intent. | Essential for understanding AI output, debugging hallucinations, and refining prompts. |
| **Exploratory Workflow** | Branching/reverting can be cumbersome; history accumulates. | Sessions enable fearless experimentation and easy discarding/reversion of trials. | Encourages rapid iteration and reduces "commit anxiety" for AI experiments. |
| **Visibility of Progress**| Primarily through `git log` and diff tools.                 | Intuitive visual timelines showing the "story" of development, making abstract concepts tangible. | Makes complex AI-driven evolution immediately comprehensible.    |

## Get Started with VibeVersion

While VibeVersion offers a powerful visual interface for managing your projects, you can quickly integrate it into your command-line workflow.

### Basic CLI Usage

```bash
# Start a new development session with a clear goal
vv start "Implementing the new personalized recommendation engine"

# Record a prompt given to your AI and its generated code
vv prompt "Generate an AI-powered recommendation algorithm based on user browse history."

# View the changes made by your AI in the current session
vv diff

# Commit your manual refinements, explicitly marking your intent
# (e.g., after reviewing and tweaking AI-generated code)
vv commit "Human refinement: Optimized database queries and added comprehensive error handling."

# Revert to a previous session or prompt state
vv revert <session_id_or_prompt_version>

# See your project's history as a linear timeline of sessions and prompts
vv history --timeline
```
