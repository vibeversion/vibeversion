## The Vibe Coding Revolution Needs a New Kind of Version Control

Vibe Coding is transforming how we build. It's an innovative development style where you collaborate directly with AI, shaping code through natural language prompts and iterative conversations. The AI generates and refines, often making broad, cross-component changes at a rapid pace.

But this revolutionary approach presents a unique challenge for traditional version control systems like Git:

* **Lost Intent**: How do you track the *intent* behind AI-generated changes when commits are vast, fragmented, or AI-driven?
* **Chaotic History**: How do you make sense of a commit history filled with countless AI micro-changes, rollbacks, and spontaneous refactors?
* **Invisible Progress**: How do you truly visualize your project's evolution when the core isn't just lines of code, but the *dialogue* with your AI partner?
* **Bridging Human & AI**: How do you seamlessly integrate your own manual refinements into an AI-driven workflow, ensuring clarity and traceability for both?

`VibeVersion` is built from the ground up to solve these problems, designed specifically for the fluid, intent-driven world of Vibe Coding.

## How VibeVersion Transforms Your Workflow

`VibeVersion` shifts the focus from managing mere code changes to **versioning your entire creative process** with AI.

* **Prompt-Centric History**: Every instruction you give your AI, every prompt, becomes a first-class citizen in your project's history. Link your prompts directly to the code they generate, ensuring you always know the "why" behind the "what."
* **Session-Based Workflow**: Organize your development journey into "sessions" â€“ distinct periods of focused work with a clear intent. Easily revisit, branch from, or revert to any point in your creative timeline.
* **Unified Project Traceability**: Beyond just code, `VibeVersion` tracks and links all your project assets: prompts, AI-generated code, configurations, design documents generated by AI, and even your test cases. See the complete lineage of any feature.
* **Seamless Human-AI Collaboration**: Integrate your manual code refinements effortlessly. `VibeVersion` clearly distinguishes human-made changes from AI-generated ones, preserving the clarity of your project's evolution.
* **Intuitive Visual Timeline**: Forget cryptic commit messages. Experience your project's history as a living timeline, showcasing key decisions, AI interactions, and the precise moment your vision came to life.

## Get Started with `VibeVersion`

While `VibeVersion` offers a powerful visual interface for managing your projects, you can quickly integrate it into your command-line workflow.

### Basic CLI Usage

```bash
# Start a new development session with a clear goal
vv start "Implementing the new personalized recommendation engine"

# Record a prompt given to your AI and its generated code
vv prompt "Generate an AI-powered recommendation algorithm based on user Browse history."

# View the changes made by your AI in the current session
vv diff

# Commit your manual refinements, explicitly marking your intent
# (e.g., after reviewing and tweaking AI-generated code)
vv commit "Human refinement: Optimized database queries and added comprehensive error handling."

# Revert to a previous session or prompt state
vv revert <session_id_or_prompt_version>

# See your project's history as a linear timeline of sessions and prompts
vv history --timeline
```
