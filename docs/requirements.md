# VibeVersion: Requirements Definition

This document outlines the fundamental **requirements** for VibeVersion, a novel code management system tailored for the era of Vibe Coding. It addresses the inherent challenges of AI-driven development, aiming to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for Vibe Coders.

## 1. Adapting to the Nature of Vibe Coding Development

Vibe Coding is characterized by a rapid, iterative cycle where humans convey their "**intent**," AI embodies it as "code," and humans then review and refine the results. The core requirement is to develop a system that facilitates this process smoothly and reduces developer burden. This means:

* **Seamless Human-AI Collaboration**: The system must inherently support the back-and-forth dialogue between developers and AI, treating AI as a first-class collaborator, not just a code generator.
* **High-Velocity Iteration Support**: It must be optimized for frequent, often broad, and experimental changes, allowing developers to quickly test and refine ideas without friction.

## 2. Preserving "Meaning" and Readability of History

Traditional code management often struggles with AI's frequent and extensive automated changes, leading to a diluted and hard-to-read history. VibeVersion must ensure that higher-level information—specifically the developer's "**intent**" and the AI's "**response**"—is preserved as a core part of the history, making it easy to trace and understand later. This entails:

* **Intent-Driven Traceability**: The primary unit of history should reflect the developer's expressed intent and the AI's subsequent actions, not just code changes.
* **Semantic Historical Context**: The system should provide context that explains *why* changes occurred (the intent) rather than just *what* changed (the code diff), allowing for meaningful retrospective analysis.

## 3. Fostering Exploratory Development

Vibe Coding is inherently exploratory programming, involving frequent experimental changes and trial-and-error. It's crucial for the system to flexibly manage these changes, encouraging developers to experiment with diverse approaches without fear of losing progress or creating unmanageable history. This includes:

* **Effortless Branching and Experimentation**: Developers should be able to create and discard experimental branches or sessions with minimal overhead, promoting fearless exploration.
* **Simplified Rollback and Recovery**: The ability to easily revert to any past state of code, intent, or session is paramount for managing the iterative nature of Vibe Coding.

## 4. Integration with Existing Tools & Extensibility

The system must coexist and integrate seamlessly with current development tools, including Git, CI/CD pipelines, and prompt management tools. Furthermore, it needs to be extensible to accommodate future advancements in AI technology and evolving development processes. This demands:

* **Interoperability with Git**: While offering a new paradigm, it must provide clear pathways for syncing with or exporting to traditional Git repositories when necessary (e.g., for deployment or long-term archiving).
* **API-First Design**: A robust API should allow for easy integration with third-party tools, custom scripts, and future AI models or development environments.

---

## 5. Intuitive Operability & Visual Experience

Vibe Coders often prefer visual and intuitive interactions. Therefore, the system must prioritize a user-friendly and highly visual UI/UX, minimizing reliance on complex command-line operations where visual feedback can enhance understanding. This means:

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Focus**: While a CLI is important for power users and automation, the primary interaction model should be through a rich, intuitive GUI that visualizes the Vibe Coding process.
* **Visualizing the "Vibe"**: The UI should make the abstract concepts of "**intent**" and "**session**" tangible and navigable, providing a clear overview of the development journey.
