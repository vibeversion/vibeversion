    * **Shall** assign a unique ID and a version number (following semantic versioning principles) to each prompt version.
    * **Shall** track the change history of prompts (who, when, what, and why a change occurred).
    * **Shall** allow easy search, referencing, and reproduction of past prompt versions.
* **R1.2 Prompt-to-Code Linkage**:
    * **Shall** clearly link and record a **complete snapshot of the code generated** by a specific prompt version.
    * **Shall** visualize how changes to a prompt impact specific parts of the generated code.
* **R1.3 Intent Clarification**:
    * **Shall** allow developers to define their **intent (charter, objective)** in natural language, linking it to associated prompts and generated code.
    * **Shall** manage the change history of these defined intents.

### 4.2 Session-Based Workflow & Timeline Management

* **R2.1 Session Management**:
    * **Shall** define and manage developer work units as distinct "**sessions**," each with a specific time frame or objective.
    * **Shall** primarily require **manual, explicit initiation and termination** of sessions by the developer, based on their intent.
    * **Shall**, however, offer an option for **automatic session initiation suggestions** triggered by specific IDE interactions (e.g., file saving, IDE's equivalent of a commit operation), configurable by the developer.
    * **Shall** record for each session: the starting code state, prompts used, AI responses, the final code state, and developer evaluations (e.g., success/failure, challenges).
    * **Shall** visualize parent-child or derivative relationships between sessions (e.g., starting a new session based on the outcome of a previous one).
* **R2.2 Timeline Visualization**:
    * **Shall** display the entire development process in a **timeline format**, intuitively showing each session, key prompt changes, and corresponding code snapshots.
    * **Shall** enable easy restoration and referencing of the code state at any past point on the timeline (similar to a state snapshot management system like Figma).
    * **Shall** allow filtering of the timeline to display specific session or prompt sequences.

### 4.3 Multi-Layered Co-Versioning & Traceability

* **R3.1 Constituent Element Co-Versioning**:
    * **Shall** version control **multiple project constituents together**, including prompts, AI-generated code, configuration files, metadata, test cases, and related documentation.
    * **Shall** allow definition of dependencies between these elements and track the impact of changes in one element on others.
* **R3.2 Traceability Assurance**:
    * **Shall** enable **bidirectional traceability** of specific code lines or components back to their originating prompt, session, and developer intent.
    * **Shall** provide mechanisms to quickly identify the causative prompt or session in case of a bug, enabling rapid rollback.
