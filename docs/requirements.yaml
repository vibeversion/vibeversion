description: A novel code management system tailored for the era of Vibe Coding,
  designed to manage intent, AI interactions, and code evolution seamlessly.

requirements:
  - id: REQ001
    title: Adaptation to Vibe Coding Process
    description: Develop a system that smoothly supports the human-AI iterative cycle
      of Vibe Coding, reducing developer burden.
    details:
      - id: REQ001.1
        title: Seamless Human-AI Collaboration
        description: The system must inherently support the back-and-forth dialogue
          between developers and AI, treating AI as a first-class collaborator.
      - id: REQ001.2
        title: High-Velocity Iteration Support
        description: Optimized for frequent, broad, and experimental changes, enabling
          quick testing and refinement.

  - id: REQ002
    title: Preservation of "Meaning" in History
    description: Ensure high-level information (developer's intent, AI's response)
      is preserved in history, easily traceable and understandable.
    details:
      - id: REQ002.1
        title: Intent-Driven Traceability
        description: Primary unit of history should reflect developer's intent and
          AI's subsequent actions, not just code changes.
      - id: REQ002.2
        title: Semantic Historical Context
        description: Provide context explaining *why* changes occurred (intent) rather
          than just *what* changed (code diff).

  - id: REQ003
    title: Fostering Exploratory Development
    description: Flexibly manage changes from exploratory programming, encouraging
      diverse approaches without fear of losing progress.
    details:
      - id: REQ003.1
        title: Effortless Branching and Experimentation
        description: Allow creation and discarding of experimental branches/sessions
          with minimal overhead.
      - id: REQ03.2 # Typo fixed from previous output
        title: Simplified Rollback and Recovery
        description: Enable easy reversion to any past state of code, intent, or session.

  - id: REQ004
    title: Integration & Extensibility
    description: Coexist and integrate seamlessly with existing development tools
      and be extensible for future advancements.
    details:
      - id: REQ004.1
        title: Interoperability with Git
        description: Provide clear pathways for syncing with or exporting to traditional
          Git repositories.
      - id: REQ004.2
        title: API-First Design
        description: Offer a robust API for easy integration with third-party tools,
          scripts, and future AI models/environments.

  - id: REQ005
    title: Intuitive Operability & Visual Experience
    description: Prioritize a user-friendly and highly visual UI/UX, minimizing
      reliance on complex command-line operations.
    details:
      - id: REQ005.1
        title: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Focus
        description: Primary interaction model should be through a rich, intuitive GUI.
      - id: REQ005.2
        title: Visualizing the "Vibe"
        description: UI should make abstract concepts of "intent" and "session" tangible
          and navigable.
